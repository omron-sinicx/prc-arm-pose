# Summary
summary: >
  We propose a pose estimation method for a lightweight 9-DOF cable-driven serpentine manipulator,
  exploiting flexibility-induced variations as computational resources through Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC).
  Our method achieves a mean pose error of 4.3 mm, comparable to an LSTM baseline and far superior to analytical models,
  enabling robust perception and control in unstructured environments.
